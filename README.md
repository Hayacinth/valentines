# 💕 Creative Valentine's Date Proposal 💕

A fun and interactive React app to propose a Valentine's date in the most creative way!

## 🎯 Features

### Interactive "No" Button - The Star of the Show!
- **Runs away across the ENTIRE screen!** When you try to hover over or click the "No" button, it jumps to a random position anywhere on the page - not just in the center card!
- **Dramatic escapes** - The button can appear anywhere on your screen, making it a fun chase
- **Mobile-friendly** - Works with touch events for mobile users
- **Minimum 5 escapes** - The button will run away at least 5 times before showing the hint
- **Shrinks with each attempt** - Gets progressively smaller every time you try to click it
- **Eventually shows just an emoji** (🙈) when it gets too small after 8+ attempts
- **Smooth animations** - Bouncy, playful movement that makes it fun to chase across your screen
- Makes it nearly impossible to say no!

### Growing "Yes" Button
- **Gets bigger** every time you interact with the "No" button
- Can grow up to 2.5x its original size
- Makes the "Yes" option more and more appealing
- Smooth scaling animations

### Playful Messages (25 Hilarious Messages!)
Messages change as you keep trying to click "No" - they get funnier and more desperate:
1. "Will you be my Valentine? 💕"
2. "Pretty please? 🥺"
3. "Are you sure about that? 💔"
4. "Come on, just say yes! 🌹"
5. "I'll buy you chocolate! 🍫"
6. "Think about all the fun we'll have! 🎉"
7. "You're making this harder than it needs to be! 😅"
8. "The button is running away... 🏃"
9. "Still chasing that No button? 🙈"
10. "You know you want to say yes! 😊"
11. "I'll throw in pizza too! 🍕"
12. "This is getting ridiculous... 😂"
13. "Fine, I'll add ice cream to the deal! 🍦"
14. "The Yes button is getting lonely... 💝"
15. "Are your fingers tired yet? 😏"
16. "I promise I don't bite! 😇"
17. "Even the button is saying 'just give up'! 🤷"
18. "Plot twist: There is no No button! 🎭"
19. "Roses are red, violets are blue, just click Yes, you know you want to! 🌹"
20. "I can do this all day! ⏰"
21. "The button has trust issues now... 🏃‍♂️"
22. "Okay, you're impressively persistent! 💪"
23. "Is this a workout routine? 🏋️"
24. "The button filed a restraining order! 📜"
25. "I admire your dedication to clicking No! 😆"

Each message is unique and gets progressively funnier as the user persists!
